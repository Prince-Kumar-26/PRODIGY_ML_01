In this task, I implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices based on three key features: square footage (GrLivArea), number of bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr), and number of bathrooms (FullBath). The goal was to develop a simple yet effective model that can estimate the price of a house based on these important attributes.
